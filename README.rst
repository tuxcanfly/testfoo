----------

A unit test is:

    * Repeatable
    * Consistent
    * In Memory
    * Fast
    * Single concern
    * Easy to debug

In contrast, an integration test is

    * Environment dependent
    * Indeterministic
    * External dependencies
    * Slow
    * Multiple concerns
    * Hard to debug
